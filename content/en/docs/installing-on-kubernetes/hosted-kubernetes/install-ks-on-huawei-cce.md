This instruction is about how to install KubeSphere 3.0.0 on [Huaiwei CCE](https://support.huaweicloud.com/en-us/qs-cce/cce_qs_0001.html).

## Preparation for Huawei CCE

### Create Kubernetes Cluster

First, create a Kubernetes Cluster according to the resources. Meet the requirements below (ignore this part if your environment is as required).

- KubeSphere 3.0.0 supports Kubernetes `1.15.x`, `1.16.x`, `1.17.x`, and `1.18.x` by default. Select a version and create the cluster, e.g. `v1.15.11`, `v1.17.9`.
- Ensure the cloud computing network for your Kubernetes cluster works, or use an elastic IP when “uto Create”or “Select Existing”; or confgiure the network after the cluster is created. Refer to Configure [NAT Gateway](https://support.huaweicloud.com/en-us/productdesc-natgateway/en-us_topic_0086739762.html).
- Select `s3.xlarge.2`  `4-core｜8GB` for nodes and add more if necessary (3 and more nodes are required for production environment).

### Create a public key for kubectl

- Go to `Resource Management` > `Cluster Management` > `Basic Information` > `Network`, and bind `Public apiserver`.
- Select `kubectl` on the right column, go to `Download kubectl configuration file`, and click `Click here to download`, then you will get a public key for kubectl.

After you get the configuration file for kubectl, use kubectl command lines to verify the connection to the cluster.

```bash
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"18", GitVersion:"v1.18.8", GitCommit:"9f2892aab98fe339f3bd70e3c470144299398ace", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-08-15T10:08:56Z", GoVersion:"go1.14.7", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"17+", GitVersion:"v1.17.9-r0-CCE20.7.1.B003-17.36.3", GitCommit:"136c81cf3bd314fcbc5154e07cbeece860777e93", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-08-08T06:01:28Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.9", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"linux/amd64"}

```

## KubeSphere Deployment

### Create a custom StorageClass

> Huawei CCE built-in Everest CSI provides StorageClass `csi-disk` which uses SATA (normal I/O) by default, but the actual disk that is for Kubernetes clusters is either SAS (high I/O) or SSD (extremely high I/O). So it is suggested that create an extra StorageClass and set it as default for later. Refer to the official document - [Use kubectl to create a cloud storage](https://support.huaweicloud.com/en-us/usermanual-cce/cce_01_0044.html).

Below is an example to create a SAS(high I/O) for its corresponding StorageClass.

```yaml
# csi-disk-sas.yaml

---
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  annotations:
    storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "true"
    storageclass.kubesphere.io/support-snapshot: "false"
  name: csi-disk-sas
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/csi-driver-name: disk.csi.everest.io
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
  # Bind Huawei “high I/O storage. If use “extremely high I/O, change it to SSD.
  everest.io/disk-volume-type: SAS
  everest.io/passthrough: "true"
provisioner: everest-csi-provisioner
allowVolumeExpansion: true
reclaimPolicy: Delete
volumeBindingMode: Immediate

```

For how to set up or cancel a default StorageClass, refer to Kubernetes official document - [Change Default StorageClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/change-default-storage-class/)。 

### Use ks-installer to minimize the deployment

Use [ks-installer](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer) to deploy KubeSphere on an existing Kubernetes cluster. It is suggested that you install it in minimal size.

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/master/deploy/kubesphere-installer.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubesphere/ks-installer/master/deploy/cluster-configuration.yaml

```

Go to `Workload` > `Pod`, and check the running status of the pod in `kubesphere-system` of its namespace to understand the minimal deployment of KubeSphere. `ks-console-xxxx` of the namespace to understand the app availability of KubeSphere console.

### Expose KubeSphere Console

Check the running status of Pod in `kubesphere-system` namespace and make sure the basic components of  KubeSphere are running. Then expose KubeSphere console.

Go to `Resource Management` > `Network` and choose the service in `ks-console`. It is suggested that you choose `LoadBalancer` (Public IP is required). The configuration is shown below.

Default settings are OK for other detailed configurations. You can also set it as you need.

After you set LoadBalancer for KubeSphere console, you can visit it via the given address. Go to KubeSphere login page and use the default account (username `admin` and pw `P@88w0rd`) to log in.

### Start add-ons via KubeSphere

When KubeSphere can be visited via the Internet, all the actions can be done on the console. Refer to the document - `Start add-ons in KubeSphere 3.0`.

💡 Notes: Before you start Istio, you have to delete `applications.app.k8s.io` built in Huawei CCE due to the CRD conflict. The simple way to do it is to use kubectl.

```bash
$ kubectl delete crd applications.app.k8s.io
```

After all add-ons are installed, go to the Cluster Management, and you will see the interface below. You can see all the started add-ons in `Add-Ons`.
